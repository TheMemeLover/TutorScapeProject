## How TutorScape Works
TutorScape is an innovative online platform facilitating peer-to-peer tutoring without financial exchange. For instance, when Sam, seeking biology help, connects with John, who desires Algebra 2 guidance, they exchange their expertise through free Zoom calls. Leveraging cutting-edge AI technology, TutorScape strategically matches users, fostering collaborative learning experiences between individuals with complementary knowledge and interests.

## React Router - Client-side Routing
React Router set up the foundations of TutorScape, as it allowed for client-side routing. In essence, traditional websites operate by having the browser ask a web server for a document, which includes downloading and assessing CSS and JavaScript assets before displaying the received HTML. When a user clicks a link, this cycle restarts for each new page. Client-side routing, on the other hand, allows applications to modify the URL from a link click without needing another server request for a new document. Instead, the app updates the interface and uses 'fetch' to request data, refreshing the page with the new information. This approach enhances user experiences by eliminating the need for the browser to request an entirely new document or re-evaluate CSS and JavaScript assets for subsequent pages. It also enables more dynamic interactions, such as smoother animations.
## React
ReactJS includes a wealth of advantages, notably in reusable components, state management, and context utilization. Reusable components elevate code efficiency and organization significantly. State management not only facilitates data storage and updates but also seamlessly triggers component re-renders. Furthermore, the versatile context feature enables seamless state sharing among components, be it child, parent, or sibling components.
## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.
